### Linters and Static Analysis [4.v]

`buoy_examples` uses and passes all the ROS2 standard linters and static analysis tools for a C++ package as described in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#linters-and-static-analysis). Passing implies there are no linter/static errors when testing against CI of supported platforms.

## Dependencies [5]

Below are evaluations of each of `buoy_examples`'s run-time and build-time dependencies that have been determined to influence the quality.

It has several "buildtool" dependencies, which do not affect the resulting quality of the package, because they do not contribute to the public library API.

It also has several test dependencies, which do not affect the resulting quality of the package, because they are only used to build and run the test code.
